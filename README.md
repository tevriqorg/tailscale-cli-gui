A macOS menu bar app for the [open-source/Homebrew Tailscale installation](https://github.com/tailscale/tailscale/wiki/Tailscaled-on-macOS).

The Mac App Store version of Tailscale includes a GUI, but the open-source CLI version (which [supports certain features](https://tailscale.com/kb/1065/macos-variants#comparison-table) like SSH hosting) does not. This app bridges that gap.

## ⚠️ PLEASE NOTE

This project is 100% vibe-coded. We let Claude Opus 4.5 write this utility (with supervision) while attending to other, more important work. Please audit the code before running.

For those interested, total cost of the project was $55.79.
